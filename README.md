[Download latest version](https://github.com/yHammes/music_system/releases/latest)

Resources can load in two formats, a ZIP format or just a regular folder with the script files inside it. The MTA:SA server supports both methods.

Move or copy the new resource to your <SERVER>\mods\deathmatch\resources folder.
In the server window type the update command, this will check the resources folder and update new resources when necessary.

Lastly, type /start music_system
